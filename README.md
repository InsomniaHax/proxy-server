# proxy-server
This script is initializing a proxy, it helps to observe and analyse packets via hexdump which I implemented, also the data gets decoded into plaintext.

## Note:
`request_handler` and `response_handler` functions are meant to be modified so you can easily edit packets. 

## Dependencies:
- sys (builtin)
- socket (builtin)
- threading (builtin)
